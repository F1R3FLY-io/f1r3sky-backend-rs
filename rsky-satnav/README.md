# rsky-satnav: Structured Archive Traversal, Navigation & Verification üõ∞Ô∏è üöò

**Work-in-Progress:**  
rsky-satnav is a prototype tool for visually exploring DASL CAR and AT Protocol repositories entirely in your browser. All processing is done locally‚Äîno data is tracked or sent externally.

## Overview

rsky-satnav lets you load a CAR file (Content-Addressable Archive) and visually inspect its contents using a collapsible, directory-style UI. It leverages MST (Merkle Sorted Tree) logic to group records by collection for an intuitive file-directory-like experience.

## Features

- **Local-Only Processing:**  
  All CAR file processing happens in your browser. No data is transmitted or stored externally.

- **Visual Exploration:**  
  View repository data in a collapsible, directory-style listing that mimics a file explorer.

- **MST-Based Grouping:**  
  Automatically groups repository records by collection, making it easier to navigate complex data structures.

## Roadmap

- **CAR Diffing:**  
  Compare different CAR files to identify changes and differences.

- **CAR Slicing:**  
  Extract and work with subsets of repository data.

- **Enhanced Sorting & Filtering:**  
  Improve UI controls to sort and filter collections more easily.

- **Blob Retrieval & Verification:**  
  Retrieve embedded Blobs and cryptographically verify CAR files.

- **External API Integration (if needed):**
    - Look up DIDs and fetch public signing keys for commit signature verification.
    - Retrieve current PDS data using `com.atproto.sync.getRepo` for downloading repositories.

## Development

rsky-satnav is built with [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) for the UI and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Prerequisites

- **Rust:** A recent version is required.
- **Node.js & npm:** Needed for managing Tailwind CSS.

### Setup

1. Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the Tailwind CSS CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
3. Run the following command in the root of the project to start the Tailwind CSS compiler:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
```

### Serving The App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

## Privacy

All file processing and data exploration is performed entirely on your local machine in the browser. No external tracking or data transmission occurs.
